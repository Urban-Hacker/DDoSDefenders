Welcome aboard! Weâ€™re thrilled to have you join the DDoS Defenders Team

DDoS attacks flood networks with malicious data, visualized as binary code, aiming to overwhelm the CPU core.

For your first day your goal will be to build a simple defense to protect the CPU core.

The simplest chip, \"SUB 1\" reduces,each packet's TTL (Time To Live) by 1.
[color=red]A packet is neutralized once its TTL becomes negative.[/color]
